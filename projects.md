The main project I am working on right now is
[NTPoly](https://william-dawson.github.io/NTPoly/), a massively parallel
library for computing the functions of sparse matrices. NTPoly is built on
techniques that exploit the sparsity of the matrix to compute matrix
functions in linear time, enabling the study of large systems.

I am also a contributor to the
[NTChem](http://labs.aics.riken.jp/nakajimat_top/EHome.html) quantum chemistry
software package which is the software my lab is developing. I'm also
collaborating with the developers of [BigDFT](http://bigdft.org/Wiki/index.php?title=BigDFT_website) which is
a density functional theory code based on the wavelet basis set.
