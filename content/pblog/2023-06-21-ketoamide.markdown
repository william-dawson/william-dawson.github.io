Summary: I announce a publication about applying our complexity reduction framework to the study of α-ketoamide inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. I also do some travel blogging about Tromsø, Norway.

I am happy to share a new publication ["Protein–ligand Interactions from a Quantum Fragmentation Perspective: The Case of the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Interacting with α-Ketoamide Inhibitors"](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0148064). This paper combines two cutting edge techniques: linear-scaling Density Functional Theory and polarizable forcefields. We spend a lot of time trying to understand how coherent of a picture they provide. Finally, we use them together to get some insight into the design of new medicines for COVID-19.

On an unrelated note, I spent the first week of June in Tromsø, Norway for [Numerical Methods in Quantum Chemistry 2023](https://mrchemsoft.no/nmqc-2023/). This was a really nice workshop, with plenty of great talks and lots of deep discussions. Perhaps the highlight was a lengthy keynote by Edward Valeev or to hear about the recent interests of Gregory Beylkin. There were tutorials as well, [including one we ran on BigDFT](https://github.com/BigDFT-group/bigdft-school/tree/main/nmqc-2023).

It was quite exciting to visit Tromsø. It is located so far north that we could enjoy the midnight sun, at least on the few days it wasn't raining! I didn't know much about Norway before going, only what I remembered from visiting Disneyworld as a kid. Somehow it to delivered on the polar bears, fjords, trolls, boats, and bakeries. Everywhere you can hear seagulls, which awoke some kind of childhood memory. The only thing missing was a stave church, which I can leave as motivation to hopefully visit the rest of Norway someday. No blog post about Norweigian style coffee this time, though I can say I drank some excellent stuff there, especially at a cafe called Tøllefsenhjørnet in town.
