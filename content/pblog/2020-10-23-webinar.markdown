On November twelfth, we will be hosting a webinar about the BigDFT
code entitled [The Flexibilities of Wavelets for Electronic Structure 
Calculations in Large Systems](http://www.max-centre.eu/webinar/flexibilities-wavelets-electronic-structure-calculations-large-systems). If
you are interested in electronic structure software or its applications
to large systems (1000+ atoms) I think you will find it quite interesting.
We will be presenting material that should be interesting to both
chemists and people who do materials science. The webinar is free to
attend, so feel free to join!
