Summary: I announce a new publication involving the development of new COVID-19 medicines.

I am happy to announce a new publication available in Chemical Science entitled
[Discovery of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro peptide inhibitors from modelling substrate and ligand binding](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/sc/d1sc03628a).
This was a collaborative effort involving many people. Our study involved both
experimental and theoretical work (docking, classical molecular dynamics, QM/MM, 
linear-scaling DFT, etc). My contribution, of course, was on the linear-scaling
DFT side of things.

The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) plays a central role in replication
of the virus. Mpro works as a kind of scissors that cuts up large polypeptides
in specific places. If one can design a drug that binds strongly to the
protease without being degraded, the protease can be deactivated, which 
would prevent  the virus from replicating. In this paper, we studied the 
binding mechanism of the protease in order to rationally design potential 
drugs. We examined both how it binds to the cleavage sites of the polypeptides
and a large database of small molecule inhibitors. This analysis gave us
design rules that helped us design new peptides which effectively inhibit
the protease.

I am curious what the reader experience will be like with this paper. I imagine 
that some readers will focus in on their particular expertise, and find 
themselves wishing we presented more calculations. For a multi-disciplinary 
paper like this though, I think quantity is its own kind of quality. You have
to find the signal that is coming through from the sum total of your analysis
techniques. This isn't to say each step wasn't caried out thoroughly, but just
a reminder that each technique is merely a tool which helps you get to that
final step of designing and experimentally testing the new drug. The paper is
available as open access so I hope you give it a read.
