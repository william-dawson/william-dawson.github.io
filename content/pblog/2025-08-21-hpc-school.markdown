Summary: I advertise an upcoming HPC school in Kobe.

I would like to advertise that in January of next year we will hold an HPC
school in Kobe. [ACM Second Asian School on High-Performance Computing and
Artificial Intelligence.](https://europe.acm.org/seasonal-schools/asean/2026)
This event is being held just after SCA/HPCAsia 2026, so it's a great time
to be in the area (Kobe for the school, Osaka for the conference).

In addition to the main focus on parallel programming and HPC, we will have
a track on materials science. We will focus on two points in this track:
1) eigenvalue problems and how they are solved and 2) use of the 
[YAMBO](https://www.yambo-code.eu/) program for many-body perturbation
theory calculations.
