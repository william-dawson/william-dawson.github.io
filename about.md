My name is William Dawson and I am currently a research scientist
at the RIKEN
[Center for Computational Science](http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/r-ccs/).
My main research interest is on designing algorithms and writing programs for
performing electronic structure calculations using the world's largest
supercomputers. In my free time, I'm enjoying the great travel destinations
and beautiful nature here in Japan. If you get a chance, I hope someday you
too can visit the wonderful city of Kobe.
