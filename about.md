My name is William Dawson and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher
at the RIKEN [Advanced Institute for Computational Science](http://www.aics.riken.jp/jp/). My main research interest are
electronic structure calculations. My current focus is on large scale
quantum chemistry calculations.

In my free time, I'm enjoying the great travel destinations and beautiful
nature here in Japan. If you get a chance, I hope someday you too can visit
the beautiful city of Kobe.
