Welcome to my personal website and blog. I'm not much of a blogger, but I
hope to put some updates on my current projects on to this page. All of
my projects can of course be found at my main [github page].

This page was made with Jekyll, which is of course standard for Github.
I'm excited to get to use all its features including mathematics:

$$H\Psi = E\Psi$$

And source code highlighting:
{% highlight fortran %}
PROGRAM myprogram
  WRITE(*,*) "Hello Blog Readers"
END PROGRAM
{% endhighlight %}

Well, hopefully not too much Fortran...
